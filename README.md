# shroomBot

What if one day you were taking a stroll in town square, and you suddenly find yourself next to a big mushroom bobbling beside you?

The idea behind these mushroom bots is to integrate into public spaces and be fun to interact with as they move around on legs or wheels. Booping or touching them will make them light up or make sound effects. And hopefully, this will serve as mushroom propaganda since mushrooms are delicious.

Here are some other types of mushrooms these bots could be:

The body would have to be 3D printed out using some kind of bouncy material, with sensors underneath to detect touch. It would be simple enough to put the body of the mushroom onto a roomba, but creating robotic walking legs would be a cool extension though there may be more complexity with balance. Another interesting extension would be to make most of the body haptic, a continuous touchable surface; I do not have as much experience in the haptic technology field, but it would be interesting to explore.
